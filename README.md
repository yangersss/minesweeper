# minesweeper
looks like a tough project but here we go!
coding minesweeper in the command line for AP Comp Sci A

important planning:
game: printing board, flagging, flipping, winning/losing
grid: stores info (2d array of tile objects)
tile: flipped/unflipped, mine/safe

TODO:
print "safe tiles left" every turn
